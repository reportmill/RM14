/**
 * FontFactory.java
 * 
 * A FontFactory object knows how to create fonts from raw data
 * pulled out of a pdf file.
 * The raw data may be just the name of the font, in which case
 * the factory should get the font however it can.
 * Alternately, the data may be actual bytes from a font embedded
 * in the pdf file.
 * 
 * In either case, the FontFactory should create a java.awt.Font 
 * object (or a subclass of Font) for use by the engine.
 * 
 * A default FontFactory object is supplied, but you can create
 * your own and set it for use with the pdfEngine.setFontFactory()
